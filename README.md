# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis
### Purpose
        The Purpose of the challenge is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
        Affter creating the Dataframe, the information will be presented in a multiple-line graph showing weekly 
        fares for each city type.  

### Results

### Differences Among City Types
The data show that urban areas have significantly more rides, drivers and total fares than suburban and rural areas. 
Urban areas also have lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fair per driver. Urban areas typically
have a higher populationi density, therefore more drivers and rides will be available. This also means there is more
competition when it comes to fares, which can explan the more competitive prices. There is less demand in the suburban and rural areas and 
there is a higher price as well.

### Pyber Summary
* For fare disparities within the Urban market, the recommendation is to increase fares gradually. With it being such an in demand service, 
gradudal fare increases will be received well and will contribute to balancing the difference across other markets.
* Suburban & rural areas should have an increase in marketing and awareness to make sure people know the service is available. Offering incentives
for returning customers or group rates might be a way to increase use.
* Rural areas with smaller populations are the smallest share of the data. Finding ways to appeal to the small town is important. Forming partnerships 
local events and entertainment venues can possibly help increase reach.
